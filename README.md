## Linkfire Data Analytics Challenge
My work on the Linkfire Data Analytics Challenge contains 3 parts:

1. A Jupyter notebook named '00_import_data.ipynb'
2. A Google Slides presentation. Can be viewed through this link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LvRY4hQUWOBFv-zz5hd6EiJpvBssXVeyggf4A4ZcW1E/edit#slide=id.p1 (The slide deck in pdf format named 'LF CASE.pdf' is also attached. Be aware that some things will look slightly different than intended in this version)

3. A Tableau Workbook named 'Traffic overview.twb' This is also published to Tableau Public and can be viewed through this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lise.a1783/viz/Trafficoverview/TrafficDashboard?publish=yes
