My work on the Linkfire Data Analytics Contains 3 parts:

1. A Jupyter notebook named `.ipynb`
2. A Tableau Workbook named `Traffic overview.tbwx`. This is also published to Tableau Public and can be viewed through this link: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lise.a1783/viz/Trafficoverview/TrafficDashboard?publish=yes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lise.a1783/viz/Trafficoverview/TrafficDashboard?publish=yes)
3. A Google Slides presentation.
